## üîÆ **Future Work: The Path to a Fully Autonomous Architecture**

This project serves as the **foundational proof-of-concept** for a fully autonomous ICS security architecture. Our current implementation demonstrates the core NILM-based detection capabilities, and our future roadmap is designed to address the full scope of the next-generation challenge:

### **1. Autonomous Response & Self-Healing** ü§ñ
Evolve the system from detection to response by building an **autonomous response mechanism**. This would enable the system to automatically trigger **device quarantine protocols**‚Äîsuch as isolating a compromised PLC or safely shutting down a malfunctioning motor‚Äîand use the NILM baseline data to verify a successful and safe recovery.

**Implementation Path:**
- **Automated Isolation Logic**: Integrate with industrial control protocols (Modbus, OPC-UA) to execute safe shutdown sequences
- **Recovery Verification**: Use power signature analysis to confirm devices return to normal operational baselines
- **Graceful Degradation**: Implement failover mechanisms that maintain critical operations during response actions

### **2. Stateful, Multi-Stage Attack Detection** üéØ
To counter persistent threats, we will enhance the detection engine to be **stateful**. This will allow it to correlate low-confidence anomalies over time to identify the subtle patterns of a **multi-stage attack**, rather than just isolated events.

**Implementation Path:**
- **Attack Pattern Memory**: Build temporal correlation engines that track attack progression across multiple devices
- **Behavioral State Machines**: Implement finite state automata to model normal vs. attack sequences
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Incorporate known attack patterns (MITRE ATT&CK for ICS) for enhanced detection

### **3. Zero-Trust and Post-Quantum Integration** üîê
To secure the system itself, our roadmap includes integrating a **Zero-Trust framework**, where the power signature of a device serves as a continuous, real-time authentication factor. The integrity of this data stream would be secured using **post-quantum cryptographic algorithms** to protect against future threats.

**Implementation Path:**
- **Continuous Device Authentication**: Use power signature fingerprinting as a hardware-based identity verification
- **Quantum-Safe Communication**: Implement lattice-based cryptography (Kyber/Dilithium) for all inter-device communication
- **Distributed Trust Consensus**: Deploy Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus for distributed decision-making in compromised environments
